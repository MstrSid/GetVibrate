    <string name="vibrate">Let\'s GO :)</string>
    <string name="pattern_one_description">Short and delicate vibration.
        Allows you to warm up and relax in front of real fun.
        A good option to start a pleasant evening :)
    </string>
    <string name="pattern_two_description">Second level. Longer and more interesting vibration
        with an arrhythmic pattern.
        Perhaps the most important thing is to get a pleasant sensation without busting vibration.
        Let the evening get hotter :)
    </string>
    <string name="pattern_three_description">Third level. Maximum, almost continuous vibration.
        For those who do not compromise and want to reach the peak of sensations as soon as possible.
        Well, a good choice, but take care of the battery :)
